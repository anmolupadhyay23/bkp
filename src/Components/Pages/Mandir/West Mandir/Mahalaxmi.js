                  intro_1="The Mahalakshmi Temple in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, is a revered Hindu pilgrimage site dedicated to Goddess Lakshmi, the consort of Lord Vishnu.  The Mahalakshmi Temple holds a unique place among Hindu pilgrimage sites. It's one of the three revered Shakti Peethas, locations associated with the fallen body parts of Sati, the consort of Lord Shiva. Here, the right hand of Sati is believed to be enshrined, imbuing the temple with immense spiritual significance."
                intro_2="Legends weave a rich tapestry around the temple's origin. One popular story recounts how Sage Bhrigu, one of the seven sages, angered Lord Vishnu by not greeting him properly.  Seeking solace, Bhrigu came to Kolhapur, where Goddess Mahalakshmi is said to have manifested, establishing her presence here."
