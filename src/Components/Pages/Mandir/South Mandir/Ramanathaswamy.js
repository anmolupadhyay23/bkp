The temple is known for its intricate carvings, expansive corridors, and its unique layout."
                history_1="The origins of the Ramanathaswamy Temple are shrouded in legend.

                history_2="Historical evidence suggests that the temple was built and expanded over several centuries. The Pandya Dynasty played a significant role in the temple's development during the 12th century. The magnificent corridors,  including the famed Hall of 1000 Pillars, were constructed by later rulers like the Sethupathi kings."
