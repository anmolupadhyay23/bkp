        title='What is Mindfulness Meditation?'
        info='Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.

        While mindfulness is something we all naturally possess, it’s more readily available to us when we practice on a daily basis.
        
        Whenever you bring awareness to what you’re directly experiencing via your senses, or to your state of mind via your thoughts and emotions, you’re being mindful. And there’s growing research showing that when you train your brain to be mindful, you’re actually remodeling the physical structure of your brain.'

        goal='The goal of mindfulness is to wake up to the inner workings of our mental, emotional, and physical processes.'
