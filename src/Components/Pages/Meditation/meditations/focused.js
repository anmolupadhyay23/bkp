        info="Focused meditation, also known as concentration meditation, is a mindfulness practice that involves focusing the mind on a single point of attention. This point of focus could be an object, such as a candle flame or a physical sensation like the breath or a mantra. The goal of focused meditation is to cultivate deep concentration, calm the mind, and develop mindfulness by training the attention to remain anchored in the present moment. This practice helps to quiet the mind, reduce distractions, and promote inner peace and clarity."
